Basic guide on how to use Sample Data Generator

1) edit disease.txt to change the different diseases
2) edit procedure.txt to change the procedures. At this point in time, the procedure must be synchronized with the disease
3) open sample_case_generator.py to change the number of cases you want to generate
4) run python code by doing "python sample_case_generator.py > output.json"
5) open "extra_items.txt" file and add the subjects and manually add them into the generated list of data. Make sure the pk is consecutive with the current data.

Loading the data into server:

to load the data into your django server, copy your output data over to your root folder and do "python manage.py loaddata output.json" in the root folder (.../mds/src)

Wait.

Done!
